### Hi there 👋
![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=emilyma53&color=blue)

I am currently a Senior at UC Berkeley (Class of 2022 🐻) majoring in Computer Science and Astrophysics. I’m originally from New York, but now based in the Bay Area.

In the past, I have contributed to various astronomy research projects and even discovered a supernova! I am passionate about art, outer space, and creating new things—especially the intersection of my interests found in physical simulations and games. 

You can learn more about me at my personal website: <a href="http://emilyma53.github.io">emilyma53.github.io</a>.
